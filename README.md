# Code Quiz

## Description

I was tasked to design and build a quiz game that was to track points, time, and save high scores, and initials. Over the course of this project, using elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I was able to complete the desired functions.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon visiting the site, you will be greeted with a little text prompt and see a button for the high score model. A little further down there will be the start button and you will be able to play through the game that will track your right and wrong answers and upon completion you will be given the option to save your initials and score. if the page is reloaded the initials and scores will be saved to the local memory.
